               For years, owners Cole & Jenny have been sharing stories and forging friendships at bar tops around the world. Memories made within Hicaho lounges, Greenwich jazz clubs, and Nashville watering holes sparked the dream to create a one-of-a-kind neighborhood cocktail room in their hometown of Bentonville.
               That&apos;s how Hardwater was born - an elevated cocktail room that can make a neighbor out of anyone.
